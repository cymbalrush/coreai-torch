"""
Annotation rendering shared by the source and program annotators.

An :class:`_Annotation` renders one operation's information as comment lines. The
annotators differ in *where* those lines go -- above a Python source line, or
beside a line of the printed Core AI program -- but not in how they are rendered,
so :class:`_AnnotatedListing` owns the rendering for both.

Styling is expressed as `rich` style names rather than ANSI escapes, so colour is
applied for a terminal and dropped for a file or in-memory stream.

:class:`_Annotation`, :class:`_TextAnnotation`, and :data:`_AnnotationCallback` are
re-exported by :mod:`~coreai_torch.debugging.source_annotator`; everything else
here is internal to the annotators.
