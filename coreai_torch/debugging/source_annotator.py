    Annotate the source of an AIProgram.

    Walks every operation in ``coreai_program`` and delegates to
    :func:`_annotate_operations`.

    Args:
        coreai_program: AIProgram whose source should be annotated.
        annotate: Maps each operation to its :class:`_Annotation`, or ``None`` to
            skip it.
        output: Text stream to write to. Defaults to ``sys.stdout``.
        exclude: Optional source-location filter. Defaults to excluding torch
            files, ``exported_program.py``, and ``"-"``.
        annotate_all_files: When True, annotate every attributed file (ordered by
            count, descending). When False, only the dominant file.
